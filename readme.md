# urlRequire
> Easy to use module to require scripts over urls 

* This does exactly what it says on the tin, it allows you to require scripts over urls
* It is a very simple module, and it is very easy to use
* It is not safe, and it is not meant to be
* It is not meant to be used for anything other than testing
* However if your dumb enough you can use this in production : )


# Install

#### Main Package

###### Even though you use this to require scripts over url, you cant require the package itself (so install it please)

```
npm i @typicalninja21/urlrequire
```

#### Optional package

* For requireSync support, you need to install the following package

> [sync-fetch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sync-fetch)
